# Repeater Divination
The Intention Repeater Tarot by Thomas Sweet/AnthroHeart (https://intentionrepeater.boards.net; https://github.com/tsweet77/openrouter-tarot) was translated by Gemini CLI (Pro 2.5) into Runes, Astrology, Kabbalah and probably others to come. Enjoy!

# EngWheelSuited.html is the ultimate version.

Geomancy's 15 "drawables" felt too slanted to negativity, and I-CHING3.py recommended me to delete it, so I did.

August 22 Update: `tarot_reader.py` was made by 4.1 Opus and uses SHA256-PBKDF2-HMAC rather than plain SHA512. `"The formula is essentially HMAC(password, salt + iteration_count)"` which is richer for free compared to the older methods. It also supports piped input, does reversals and "verifies its output".

September 24: divination.html was an 1 file Divination system that combines Tarot, I Ching, Kabbalah and Runes. DIVINATION.py is its older Python version.<br>
DivinationColors.html was the v2, with a grid of numbers. DivinationColors2.html includes an automated button.<br>
DivinationColors3.html is the newest version with < > buttons for going back and forth on automated draws.<br>
DivinationToolAdvanced.html includes Dreamspell and Taixuanjing, a Chinese divination book, similar to IChing, but with 81 tetragrams.<br>
DivinationAdvancedTool2.html includes Lingqinjing.<br>

DivinationAdvancedTool3.html includes Astrology, Ogham, and Meihua Yishu, as well as removing the number grid. This is the ultimate version.

All older files are obsolete and will be upgraded with the new mechanisms soon.

TAROT.py was further beautified/cleaned up by GPT5. AnthroHeart/@Anthro really likes it.<br>
TAROT2.py makes it automatic as I-CHING3.py.

WHEEL.py uses a spinning wheel to generate cards. Hashes are selected by pressing Enter.

I-CHING.py was the equivalent for I-Ching. I-CHING2.py is "Ok, made an update so that it always displays text in the Image, and it keeps up the animation message until drawn." I-CHING3.py is more detailed, but you may prefer to use 2 instead. Your choice.

KABBALAH2.py is MKabbalahv6a.py translated to the new system. KABBALAH3.py was made "automatic" like I-CHING3.py is. You can choose to use it or not.<br>
KABBALAH4.py becomes like I-CHING3.py: varying results by timestamp.

Likewise for RUNES.py.

ANTHRO_ORACLE.py draws animal totems. It isn't automatic.

---

Symmetrical runes (that look the same any side) such as Gebo do not traditionally have a reversed form. Despite this, recent tool versions do include their reversed forms.

MKabbalahv2.py was 888k `THINK_DEPTH` and contained Excessive (too much) and Deficient (too little) Sephiroth. This gives in total 30 possible meanings for each slot and is I believe better than involving the Qlippoth (the evil side). This version doesn't have the Lightning Flash (the proper order that is always the same) 

MKabbalahv3.py shifted the B/E/D rate to 50/25/25.<br>
MKabbalahv4.py added the 22 Paths.<br>
MKabbalahv5.py added a Variable Path Reading.<br>
MKabbalahv6.py added the Horizontal Reading (Archetypal/Creative/Formative/Material)<br>
MKabbalahv6a.py added the 4 Worlds (Horizontal) as 1 option.<br>

August 1, 2025: Added 2Astrology.py, which contains Transits.
5Astrology.py contains Parallels and Conjunctions (sextiles, squares etc). Each new revision has more information.

6Astrology.py includes Ceres, Juno, Vesta... Eris, Makemake, Gonggong etc. This produces an extraordinary information volume: if you don't need these smaller bodies (as they can muddle up a reading by inventing wrong details about wounds [Ceres iirc], etc), use 5Astrology.py.

cio.py is a non-interactive experiment in generating hashed readings from the AnthroHeart Cio Saga.

The Tarot file is GPL3, and since all the other files were derived from it, they're too.
