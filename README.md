# Repeater Divination
The Intention Repeater Tarot by Thomas Sweet/AnthroHeart (https://intentionrepeater.boards.net; https://github.com/tsweet77/openrouter-tarot) was translated by Gemini CLI (Pro 2.5) into Lenormand, Geomancy, Runes and probably others to come. Enjoy!
A Lenormand Grand Tableau file was attempted, but it didn't feel like a good divinatory method.

The Tarot file is GPL3, and since all the other files were derived from it, they're too.
