# Repeater Divination
The Intention Repeater Tarot by Thomas Sweet/AnthroHeart (https://intentionrepeater.boards.net; https://github.com/tsweet77/openrouter-tarot) was translated by Gemini CLI (Pro 2.5) into Lenormand, Geomancy, Runes and probably others to come. Enjoy!

A Lenormand Grand Tableau file was attempted, but it didn't feel like a good divinatory method.

July 27 Update MultiHasher Hashes: The Tarot and Lenormand files are safe from corruption and interference by negatives (Tarot strongly so), but the Geomancy and Runes are not. The answer for the Runes file felt different from Geomancy, weirder.

The Tarot file is GPL3, and since all the other files were derived from it, they're too.
